        "# **Crime Trends in Large and Medium Jurisdictions**\n",
        "By Aaron Margolis\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook is an update of Mean Shift Analysis I first performed in 2017 to examine the recent increases in crime following the historic decrease during the late 1990s and early 2000s. For instance, was crime increasing everywhere or just in certain cities, such as Baltimore? By grouping cities into clusters based on their crime patterns over time, we can see  where crime is continuing to fall and where it is rising.\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook will look at crime rates in jurisdictions over 250,000 people. These 131 jurisdictions account for approximately 30% of the US population. They are a mix of urban areas such as cities and suburbs, and also suburban counties. Urban areas are over-represented, but there are enough lower density jurisdictions to conduct analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "This analysis can be expanded to look at smaller jurisdictions, especially using a more powerful backend. I  incorporated TensorFlow 2.0 and its eager execution capability. Because there are only 600 columns for 131 jurisdiction, or 78,600 data points, this notebook uses CPUs rather GPUs or TPUs. If more jurisdictions were incorporated, a more powerful backend can be added.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Results:**\n",
        "\n",
        "Where crime was highest in the late 1990s, such as New York and other large cities, crime continues to be down considerably. But in rural jurisdictions, such as Anchorage and Wichita, the amount of crime today is much higher than it was 25 years ago, despite the large overall decrease in crime. There has been an increase in most of these jurisdictions in the last few years. The large variation in crime trends across jurisdictions explains the differing perception of crime overall."
