## Geometric Deep Learning Study Group
We're working on our way through ["Geometric Deep Learning: Grids, Groups, Graphs, Geodesics, and Gauges"](https://geometricdeeplearning.com/book/)
by Michael M. Bronstein, Joan Bruna, Taco Cohen, Petar Veličković
We’ll use the chapters rather than the big pdf, and also presenting on other papers.
